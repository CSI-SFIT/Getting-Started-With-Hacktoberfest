**[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)** is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio, open to everyone in our global community!.

### <a name="How to make a Pull request">ü§≠ How to make a Pull request</a>

So, you know how to use Git and have a GitHub account yourself. You have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo and can push to it. All is well. But how do you contribute to other people's GitHub projects? 

**Creating a pull request**
1. When you want to work on a GitHub project, the first step is to fork a repo.
<br>Use [our demo pull request repo](https://github.com/CSI-SFIT/Demo-Pull-Request-Repo) to try it out.

<p align="center">
<img src="Images/DemoPR.png" alt="DemoPR Image">
</p>

2. Once there, click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
<br>This creates a new copy of my demo repo under your GitHub user account with a URL like:
`https://github.com/<YourUserName>/Demo-Pull-Request-Repo` <br>
<br>**The copy includes all the code, branches, and commits from the original repo.**
<p align="center">
<img src="Images/Forking.gif" alt="Fork gif">
</p>

3. Next, clone the repo by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:
`git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/Demo-Pull-Request-Repo`

4. Once the repo is cloned, you need to create a new branch by issuing the command:
`git checkout -b new_branch_for_new_feature`

5. Create a new remote for the upstream repo with the command:
<br>`git remote add upstream https://github.com/<YourUserName>/Demo-Pull-Request-Repo`
<br>In this case, "upstream repo" refers to the original repo you created your fork from.
<br>Now you can make changes to the code, commit and push them.

6. Once you push the changes to your repo, the **Compare & pull request** button will appear in GitHub.

7. Open a pull request by clicking the **Create pull request** button.
<br>This allows the repo's maintainers to review your contribution. From here, they can merge it if it is good, or they may ask you to make some changes.

**In summary**, if you want to contribute to a project, the simplest way is to:

1.  Find a project you want to contribute to and Fork it
2.  Clone it to your local system
3.  Make a new branch
4.  Make your changes
5.  Push it back to your repo
6.  Click the  **Compare & pull request**  button
7.  Click  **Create pull request**  to open a new pull request

If the reviewers ask for changes, repeat steps 4 and 5 to add more commits to your pull request.

### <a name="Let's get to work!">üòÑ Let's get to work!</a>

Now all you gotta do is make four more pull requests to any open source project you want hosted on Github and contribute anything between **October 1 to October 31 midnight in 2020.**<br><br>
It doesn‚Äôt need to be code. It can be even documentation or even a spelling fix but meaningful.<br>
You will find plenty of issues labeled with [Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) or  [good-first-issue](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Agood-first-issue+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) etc. on Github. These will be the simple ones most probably and easy to fix.

### <a name="Newbie to Open Source?">üòå Newbie to Open Source?</a>

Hacktoberfest's plain objective is:
> Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt!

But, it‚Äôs not just about the t-shirts or stickers but about **supporting free and open source software**. It's about celebrating open source, and giving it back. If you‚Äôve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started because Hacktoberfest provides a large list of available contribution opportunities (and yes, there are always **plenty** for beginners too).
<br><br>
Making that first leap into open source is an intimidating endeavor. Knowing where to start is extremely challenging because of how open-ended open source can be. This is especially the case for junior developers. So then, how _does_ one actually get started with open source?

**Let's start at your first contribution shall we?**
- [üöÄ‚ú® Help beginners to contribute to open source projects](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

- [Up for Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

- [goodfirstissues.com](https://goodfirstissues.com/) is a site that aggregates _the latest issues_ with the label ‚ÄúGood First Issue‚Äù, which is a GitHub feature for finding easy issues to tackle (see [here](https://github.blog/2020-01-22-how-we-built-good-first-issues)).

### <a name="What Hacktoberfest Truly Means">ü§® What Hacktoberfest Truly Means</a>

Not all treasures are material! This is a **key milestone** in your young career: open source contributions! To get the opportunity to engage more deeply with  local developer community through a number of Hacktoberfest Meetup events as well as contribute for a greater cause.<br><br>
By putting on events such as these, it promotes and generates involvement in one's own community, whether it be online, in person. A great opportunity to poke around in the inner workings of major open-source libraries. And well, formally **introduce yourself to the world of open source by giving back**.
